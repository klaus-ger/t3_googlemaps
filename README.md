t3_googlemaps
=============


This is an example extension to show the possbilities of clickable polygons and markers inside a TPO3 Extension.We render for each PLZ first digit Region (PLZ 1XXXX) an overlay which hover and is clickable to set a new map zoom with a detail view of the fist two PLZ digits (18xxx).

The Extension combiens the map view with an (Ajax) result List and some search filters. 

The complete Source code is descripted in an tutorial, see: http://t3-developer.com/tutorials/typo3-extension-und-google-maps/


Its up to you to build some exciting user experiance - like holiday regions and hotels, companys and stores ...
